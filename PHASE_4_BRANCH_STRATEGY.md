# Phase 4: Branch Strategy Cleanup Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a clean, organized Git branch strategy for the Clinical Case Compass project to improve development workflow, code quality, and collaboration.

## 1. Git Branch Organization

### Branch Hierarchy
```
main/                           # Production-ready code
├── develop/                   # Integration branch for features
├── feature/                   # Feature development branches
│   ├── feature/auth-enhancement          # Authentication improvements
│   ├── feature/case-management          # Case CRUD operations
│   └── feature/design-system           # UI/UX design system work
├── refactor/                  # Code refactoring branches
│   ├── refactor/component-consolidation  # Component cleanup & organization
│   ├── refactor/design-system-cleanup   # Design system optimization
│   └── refactor/architecture-reorganization  # Structural improvements
└── hotfix/                    # Critical bug fixes
    └── hotfix/template        # Template for emergency fixes
```

### Branch Purposes

#### `main/`
- **Purpose**: Production-ready, stable code
- **Protection**: Protected branch with required reviews
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to production
- **Merging**: Only from `develop` or `hotfix/*` branches

#### `develop/`
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for completed features
- **Usage**: Staging environment deployment
- **Merging**: Receives completed `feature/*` and `refactor/*` branches
- **Testing**: Comprehensive integration testing occurs here

#### `feature/*`
- **Purpose**: New feature development
- **Naming**: `feature/brief-description` (kebab-case)
- **Lifetime**: Created from `develop`, merged back to `develop`
- **Examples**: 
  - `feature/auth-enhancement`
  - `feature/case-management`
  - `feature/design-system`

#### `refactor/*`
- **Purpose**: Code improvement without changing functionality
- **Naming**: `refactor/area-being-refactored` (kebab-case)
- **Priority**: High priority for cleanup phases
- **Examples**:
  - `refactor/component-consolidation`
  - `refactor/design-system-cleanup`
  - `refactor/architecture-reorganization`

#### `hotfix/*`
- **Purpose**: Critical bug fixes that need immediate deployment
- **Naming**: `hotfix/bug-description` (kebab-case)
- **Lifetime**: Created from `main`, merged to both `main` and `develop`
- **Example**: `hotfix/auth-security-vulnerability`

## 2. Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Branch Setup ✅
- [x] Create `develop` branch from `main`
- [x] Create primary `feature/*` branches
- [x] Create primary `refactor/*` branches
- [x] Create `hotfix/template` for emergency use

### Phase 2: Migration Planning
1. **Audit Existing Branches**
   - Identify active development branches
   - Categorize by purpose (feature, refactor, hotfix)
   - Assess completion status and merge readiness

2. **Branch Consolidation**
   - Merge completed features into `develop`
   - Archive obsolete branches
   - Migrate active work to new branch structure

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update contributing guidelines
   - Create branch workflow documentation
   - Update CI/CD pipeline configurations

### Phase 3: Workflow Implementation

#### Feature Development Workflow
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Development work
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature component"
git push origin feature/new-feature-name

# Create PR to develop
# After review approval, merge to develop
# Delete feature branch after merge
```

#### Refactor Workflow
```bash
# Start refactor work
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b refactor/area-to-refactor

# Refactoring work (maintain functionality)
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: consolidate similar components"
git push origin refactor/area-to-refactor

# Create PR to develop with detailed testing notes
# Ensure all tests pass and functionality preserved
```

#### Hotfix Workflow
```bash
# Emergency fix needed
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# Fix implementation
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical security issue"
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# Create PR to main AND develop
# Deploy immediately after approval
```

## 3. Branch Protection Rules

### `main` Branch Protection
- Require pull request reviews (minimum 2 reviewers)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require up-to-date branches before merging
- Restrict direct pushes
- Include administrators in restrictions

### `develop` Branch Protection
- Require pull request reviews (minimum 1 reviewer)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require up-to-date branches before merging
- Allow fast-forward merges only

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Updates

### Build Triggers
- **`main`**: Production deployment
- **`develop`**: Staging deployment + comprehensive testing
- **`feature/*`**: Feature branch testing + preview deployments
- **`refactor/*`**: Extended testing suite + performance benchmarks
- **`hotfix/*`**: Emergency deployment pipeline

### Testing Strategy
```yaml
# Example CI configuration
branches:
  main:
    - unit-tests
    - integration-tests
    - e2e-tests
    - security-scans
    - performance-tests
    - deploy-production
    
  develop:
    - unit-tests
    - integration-tests
    - e2e-tests
    - deploy-staging
    
  feature/*:
    - unit-tests
    - integration-tests
    - build-verification
    - preview-deployment
    
  refactor/*:
    - unit-tests
    - integration-tests
    - performance-comparison
    - memory-leak-detection
    
  hotfix/*:
    - unit-tests
    - security-scans
    - emergency-deployment
```

## 5. Migration Checklist

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Update `.github/workflows/` configurations
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Create PR templates for each branch type
- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
- [ ] Notify team of new workflow

### Branch Migration Tasks
- [ ] Audit and categorize existing 100+ branches
- [ ] Identify merge-ready features for `develop`
- [ ] Archive or delete obsolete branches
- [ ] Migrate active work to new structure
- [ ] Update all open PRs to target correct branches

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README.md with new workflow
- [ ] Create branch workflow diagrams
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## 6. Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include ticket numbers when applicable: `feature/auth-123-oauth-integration`

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): short description

Longer description if needed

- Bullet points for changes
- Reference issues: Fixes #123
```

### Merge Strategy
- **Feature branches**: Squash and merge to `develop`
- **Refactor branches**: Merge commit to preserve refactor history
- **Hotfix branches**: Merge commit to both `main` and `develop`
- **Develop to main**: Merge commit for release tracking

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

### Weekly Reviews
- Branch health check (stale branches, large branches)
- CI/CD pipeline performance review
- Merge conflict analysis and prevention

### Monthly Audits
- Branch cleanup (delete merged branches)
- Workflow effectiveness assessment
- Team feedback collection and implementation

## 8. Rollback Strategy

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Production Issue**: Create immediate hotfix branch
2. **Feature Rollback**: Revert merge commit on `develop`
3. **Complete Rollback**: Reset `main` to last known good commit
4. **Communication**: Notify team via established channels

### Recovery Procedures
- Maintain backup of current branch structure
- Document rollback decision process
- Post-incident review and process improvement

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check current branch structure
git branch -a | grep -E "(main|develop|feature/|refactor/|hotfix/)"

# Clean up local branches
git branch -d $(git branch --merged=develop | grep -v develop)

# Sync with remote
git fetch --prune origin

# Switch to development workflow
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Status**: ✅ Core branch structure implemented
**Next Phase**: Begin migration of existing branches to new structure
