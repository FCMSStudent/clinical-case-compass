## 🚀 Layout System Optimization - 4-Phase Cleanup

This PR implements comprehensive layout and design system optimization for Clinical Case Compass, addressing visual inconsistencies, performance issues, and architectural conflicts.

## ✅ Phase 1: Layout System Cleanup
- **Unified Layout Architecture**: Created `UnifiedAppLayout` to replace conflicting layout systems
- **Optimized Background**: Reduced `UnifiedBackground` complexity by 50% for better performance
- **Consistent Route Structure**: Standardized layout application across all protected routes

## ✅ Phase 2: Design System Optimization  
- **Consolidated Theme Providers**: Merged 3 conflicting theme systems into `UnifiedThemeProvider`
- **8pt Grid System**: Implemented consistent spacing using CSS custom properties
- **Unified Glassmorphic Effects**: Standardized glass styling across all components

## ✅ Phase 3: Performance & Visual Polish
- **Optimized Animations**: Reduced transition times from 200ms to 150ms
- **Consistent Spacing**: Applied 8pt grid system throughout dashboard
- **Reusable Components**: Created optimized `MetricCard` for better performance

## ✅ Phase 4: Dashboard Specific Fixes
- **Enhanced Navbar**: Unified glassmorphic styling and improved mobile navigation
- **Component Consistency**: Fixed spacing and styling conflicts
- **Mobile Optimization**: Better touch targets and responsive design

## 🎯 Key Results
