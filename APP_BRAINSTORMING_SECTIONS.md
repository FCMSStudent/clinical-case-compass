# Application Sections for Brainstorming Changes: Clinical Case Compass

This document outlines a proposed organization for dividing the Clinical Case Compass application into logical sections for brainstorming changes and new features.

## I. Foundational & Core User Experience
These sections are fundamental to the app's operation and the primary user journey. Brainstorming here focuses on the entry points, overall structure, and initial user engagement.

1.  **User Authentication & Profile Management:**
    *   **Current Purpose:** Handles user sign-up, login, logout, and potentially password resets. May include a basic user profile page.
    *   **Brainstorming Focus:** Social login options, two-factor authentication (2FA), enhanced profile customization, password strength policies, account recovery improvements, admin user management.

2.  **Navigation & Application Shell:**
    *   **Current Purpose:** Provides the main layout (sidebar, header), navigation links, and routing logic.
    *   **Brainstorming Focus:** Improved information architecture, global search, breadcrumbs, customizable shortcuts, accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, screen reader support), notifications system.

3.  **Dashboard & User Overview:**
    *   **Current Purpose:** Serves as the user's landing page, offering summaries, quick access, and activity overview.
    *   **Brainstorming Focus:** Personalized widgets, user-configurable layout, deeper stats/progress visualization, gamification, announcements, "continue where you left off" features.

## II. Content Creation & Management (Primarily for "Case Authors")
This group is centered around the lifecycle of clinical cases from the perspective of those who build and manage them.

4.  **Case Creation & Editing:**
    *   **Current Purpose:** Enables users (likely instructors) to build and modify clinical cases through a structured flow.
    *   **Brainstorming Focus:** Intuitive UI/UX, rich text/media embedding, case templates, version history, collaborative creation, import/export, AI-assisted content, advanced branching logic.

5.  **Case Library & Management:**
    *   **Current Purpose:** Allows authors to view, organize, publish, and manage created cases.
    *   **Brainstorming Focus:** Advanced search/filtering (tags, difficulty), bulk actions, case sharing, analytics on case usage, peer review workflows, organization into collections/curricula.

## III. Content Consumption & Learning (Primarily for "Students/Learners")
This group focuses on how users interact with and learn from the clinical cases.

6.  **Interactive Case Simulation/Study:**
    *   **Current Purpose:** The core learning environment where students interact with cases, make decisions, and receive feedback.
    *   **Brainstorming Focus:** Dynamic/adaptive pathways, enhanced feedback mechanisms, multimedia integration (videos, audio), hint systems, note-taking, post-case debriefing, timed/team modes.

7.  **Educational Resources:**
    *   **Current Purpose:** Provides access to supplementary learning materials, articles, or guidelines.
    *   **Brainstorming Focus:** Contextual resource integration within simulations, user-generated content/forums, multimedia resource library, quizzes, personalized recommendations.

8.  **Scheduling/Planning:**
    *   **Current Purpose:** Potentially allows users to schedule study time or plan case work.
    *   **Brainstorming Focus:** Calendar integration, study plan creation/tracking, reminders, group study coordination, curriculum integration.

## IV. General & Cross-Cutting Concerns
These aspects are pervasive and should be considered both in dedicated sessions and as integral parts of brainstorming for any of the sections above.

9.  **User Interface (UI) & Shared Components:**
    *   **Focus (as a section):** New themes, developing new generic UI components, improving existing shared components.
    *   **Focus (as cross-cutting):** Ensuring UI consistency, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility across all features.

10. **Other Cross-Cutting Concerns (to be woven into all brainstorming):**
    *   **Overall User Experience (UX) & Usability:** Holistic review of user journeys and ease of use.
    *   **Performance:** Application speed, responsiveness, and resource usage.
    *   **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensuring usability for people with disabilities (WCAG compliance).
    *   **Security:** Protecting user data and application integrity.
    *   **Data Management & Integrity:** Consistency, reliability, and backup of application data.
    *   **Mobile Responsiveness & Cross-Device Compatibility:** Ensuring a good experience on all devices.

## How to Use This Organization for Brainstorming:

*   **Focused Sessions:** Dedicate brainstorming meetings to specific sections or groups.
*   **Holistic View:** Periodically review ideas across sections to see how they interrelate.
*   **Integrate Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Ensure that discussions for any section also address relevant cross-cutting concerns (e.g., performance, accessibility implications).
