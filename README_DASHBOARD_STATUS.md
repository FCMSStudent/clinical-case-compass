# Dashboard Status Report

## Current State
The dashboard has been fixed and should now display properly. Here's what you should see:

## Scenario 1: Database Setup Required (Most Likely)
If you see a screen with a database icon:
- **Message**: "Database Setup Required"
- **Cause**: Missing Supabase environment variables
- **Fix**: Create a `.env` file with:
  ```
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
  ```

## Scenario 2: Demo Mode Working
If the app is in offline mode, you should see:
- **2 Demo Cases**: "Acute Chest Pain in Young Adult" and "Pediatric Fever Investigation"
- **Metrics Cards**: Showing totals for cases, patients, etc.
- **Recent Activity**: List of case updates
- **Quick Actions**: Buttons to create new cases
- **Working Dashboard**: All components functioning with sample data

## Scenario 3: Authentication Required
If Supabase is configured but you're not logged in:
- **Message**: "Authentication Required"
- **Action**: Click "Sign In" button

## Debug Information
The top-right corner should show debug info like:
```
Loading: false | Data: exists | Cases: 2 | User: none
```

1. ✅ Empty dashboard issue resolved
